    %h3 Search Alerts
    %p
      Search alerts notify you when a new document that you care about shows up. Track information like -
      %em
        = link_to 'building permits', 'documents/search?q=building+permits'
      or
      %em
        = link_to 'construction projects', 'documents/search?q=construction+projects'
      in your area, be notified when something happens on
      %em your street
      or follow a topic like
      %em
        = link_to 'medical marijuana.', 'documents/search?q=medical+marijuana'


    %h3 Tips for your search alert
    %blockquote
      There are ways you can refine your search alert to get more specific results. If you are interested in a specific state add
      %strong
        %em municipality_state:VT
      to search only in Vermont.
      If you are only interested in your town try this:
      %strong
        %em municipality_slug:killington-vt
      which narrows your search alert to a specific town, in this case Killington, VT.
    %blockquote
      Adding quote around a search means that we'll look for that exact phrase. So
      %em 'building permits'
      is different than
      %em building permits.
    %blockquote
      If you are only interested in agendas for meetings that might mention your street you can use this:
      %em 'Main Street municipality_slug:killington-vt classification:agenda'

      In all cases, the results are only as accurate as the robot-generated metadata. If you have questions, please

              %td
                = best_in_place alert, :querystring, :type => :input
              %td
                .btn.pull-right= link_to "Delete",  {:action => "destroy", :id => alert.id}, :method => :delete, :confirm => "Are you sure"
